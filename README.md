# OpenCV_Projects

This repository includes any projects that I have completed with research, projects, or online classes that I will refer to. My main focus is on studying fields that cross Machine Learning (Convolutionary Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, and Clustering of K-means), Computer Vision, and Data Science so I can work with Self Driving Cars.

The projects I plan on learning will be on the following topics. 


# Sections: 
### Basics of Computer Vision and Opencv
